# Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Task

## Introduction

Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship task repository! In this single Jupyter Notebook file, `Oasis_infobyte_Data_science.ipynb`, you will find the code and documentation for three data science tasks completed during the internship. The tasks and their descriptions are as follows:

## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

**Description:** In the first task, we tackled the classic machine learning problem of Iris Flower Classification. Our goal was to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Results:** We successfully built a machine learning model with high accuracy for classifying iris flowers.

## Task 2: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

**Description:** The second task involved predicting the prices of cars using machine learning techniques. We used a dataset containing various features of cars, such as make, model, year, mileage, and more, to develop a regression model for price prediction.

**Results:** Our machine learning model demonstrated strong predictive performance, making it a valuable tool for estimating car prices.

## Task 3: Sales Price Prediction using Python

**Description:** In this real-world application of data science, we focused on predicting sales prices based on relevant features. The dataset included factors such as item condition, shipping cost, and brand name.

**Results:** We successfully developed a model for sales price prediction, which can assist in pricing strategies.
